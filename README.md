# x build

A *simple* tool for building and running c/c++ programs with cmake

Just a simple tool for myself, not very flexible right now so probably not a
great tool for most people

## Usage

create a new project directory and cd into it then run:
```
$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacklukem/xbuild/main/x > ./x
$ chmod +x ./x
$ ./x init
```
